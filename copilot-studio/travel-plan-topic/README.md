## Minimal path to awesome

1. Open a copilot in **Copilot Studio**
1. Select **Topics**
1. Select **+ Add a topic**
1. Select **From blank**
1. Change the name from **Untitled** to **Travel Plan**
1. Select **More**
1. Select **Open code editor**
1. Paste the contents of the **[YAML-file](./source/travel-plan.yaml)** in the code editor
1. Select **Close code editor**

    Don't worry about the error you'll see in the message card, later on that will disappear.

1. Select the **+** after the adaptive card to add a node
1. Select **Call an action** in the popout
1. Select **Create a prompt** in the next area

    This will open the AI Builder prompt builder

1. Enter **Travel Plan** as the name for the prompt at the top
1. Enter the following prompt as the prompt:

    `Pease give me [Number] options for activities in [Destination] for people who are there for the first time. Please return a numbered list with emojis in the name of the activity and give it a brief description.`

1. Under Prompt settings, select **Input**
1. Select **+ Add input**
1. Enter **Number** as the name
1. Enter **3** as the sample data
1. Select **+ Add input** again
1. Enter **Destination** as the name
1. Enter **Amsterdam, The Netherlands** as the sample data
1. Select **[Number]** in the prompt and remove it from the prompt, leaving the cursor on that spot
1. Select the **+ Insert** button
1. Select **Number** in the popout - this will add the input to your prompt
1. Select **[Destination]** in the prompt and remove it from the prompt, leaving the cursor on that spot
1. Select the **+ Insert** button again
1. Select **Destination** in the popout to add destination to the prompt as well

    Now you have replaced the text with actual inputs, and this means you can now test the prompt

1. Select the **Test prompt** button under the prompt to test the prompt with the sample data

    This will show an example output of the prompt response in the Prompt response section

1. Select the **Save custom prompt** button
1. Back in Copilot Studio, you will not directly see the prompt. Make sure to search for **Travel Plan** and it will show for you
1. Select **Travel Plan**

1. Select **>** in the **Destination** input and select the **destination** variable (this is the output of the adaptive card)
1. Select **>** in the **Number** input and select the **number** variable
1. Select **>** in the **predictionOutput** output and select the **Create new** button to create a new variable

    This will automatically create a variable called *Var1*.

1. Select **Var1**

    This will open the *Variable properties* panel

1. Change the name from **Var1** to **promptOutput**
1. Close the **Variable properties** panel
