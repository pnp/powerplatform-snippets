# Halloween Animation

This custom PowerApps component brings Halloween to life with animated visuals and a chilling twist: it uses a non-standard font embedded directly in the component, requiring no installation on the user's device.
Designed for fun and fright, this component is perfect for:
- Creating Halloween-themed screens or splash pages
- Surprising your colleagues with spooky UI tricks
- Demonstrating how to embed and use custom fonts in PowerApps without local installation
Whether you're building a haunted app experience or showcasing creative component design, this YAML-based animation is a playful and technical treat for Makers everywhere 👻

Would you like a shorter version for a banner or a version in French as well? I can also help you write a README-style description or a post for sharing it with the Power Platform community!
